Using HTML and CSS, I created a photography agency website consisting of five pages. Display:flex was a key tool in designing the website, allowing for more dynamic layouts. To further enhance the user experience, I implemented hover effects on images and edited the scrollbar to make it more visually appealing. Additionally, I used JavaScript to create a responsive navigation menu for seamless navigation on mobile devices. The website was designed entirely by me, allowing me to hone my design skills as well as my coding abilities. I also ensured that the website was fully responsive for all devices. As a final touch, I implemented some basic SEO optimization to increase the website's visibility online. Overall, this project represents a significant milestone in my journey towards becoming an experienced web developer.

To enhance the aesthetics of the website, I incorporated high-quality images from free websites, such as Unsplash, and ensured that all images were available for free commercial use. The logo for the website was designed using free resources from online design websites, which allowed me to create a visually appealing logo without incurring any additional costs. To add icons to the website, I utilized Fontawesome, a free resource for icon sets. By utilizing these free resources, I was able to create a professional and polished website without having to spend additional funds on design assets.

This project represents just the beginning of my journey in web development. I'm excited to continue honing my coding skills and taking on new projects to further refine my abilities.
